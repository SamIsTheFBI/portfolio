# Portfolio

This is a basic React portfolio site created using Vite and styled with Tailwind CSS. I made this to practice Tailwind.

## Getting Started

>Pre-requisites: Vite requires Node.js version 14.18+, 16+. However, some templates require a higher Node.js version to work, please upgrade if your package manager warns about it.

- Clone this repository. 
- Install dependencies and run the development server with npm:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 on your browser to see the website. You can add `--host` flag to host it on your local network.
